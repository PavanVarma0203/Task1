# Task1
I have loaded a dataset, checked for missing and duplicate values, and formatted date columns into a consistent structure. 
I have extracted text-based columns and converted categorical data into labeled representations using one-hot encoding. 
I have standardized column names by converting them to lowercase and replacing spaces with underscores. 
Finally, I have ensured that specific columns are treated as integers for better processing, improving data consistency and preparing the dataset for further analysis.
